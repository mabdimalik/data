# Somalia Health Facilities Location

This data on locations of health facilities was originally collected by the WHO Africa; this version was extracted from data shared by the Afrimapr project on github [afrihealthsites](https://github.com/afrimapr/afrihealthsites). A census of health service providers maybe crucial to the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic when used in conjunction with other information. 

Thank you!
